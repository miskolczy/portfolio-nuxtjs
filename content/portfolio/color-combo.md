For years, ‹A Dictionary of Color Combinations› by Wada Sanzō (1883–1967) has served as a source of inspiration in my design process. The book presents selected color combinations as square color fields placed side by side, which I enjoy browsing through. The question was: How can these combinations be seamlessly integrated, experimented with, and tested in modern design processes?

To answer that, I began developing a tool, building on Wada Sanzō's color harmonies. It's evolved to let you generate color combos from any primary color using different harmony rules: polychromatic (complementary, triadic, square), monochromatic, and analogous. You can try it out on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1513946409035960179 "") or in the browser on [GitHub Pages](https://miskolczy.github.io/color-combo "").
