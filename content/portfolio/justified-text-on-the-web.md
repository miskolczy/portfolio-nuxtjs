For my Bachelor Thesis I have designed an online newspaper for which I created a variable font that can be used in justified texts. This typeface originally was supposed to bring back the typical newspaper character to journalistic online media. While working on my typeface, I discovered general issues regarding typefaces used online. I therefore created a new and better way to display them online. You can read more about it on [Medium](https://medium.com/@miskolczy/justified-text-on-the-web-3d30a540eeb4 "").

The variable font I have been designing is called Dorn and is inspired by typefaces of printed newspapers. Dorn is a typical Antiqua and can be distinguished by dynamic buoyancy. My typeface Dorn was designed to be read on a computer screen comfortably. In order to enable legibility, Dorn had to be designed with a small line contrast, emphasised serifs and a greater x-height. This variable font also contains two design axis therefore the width and boldness of the letters can be adjusted smoothly to the size of the screen of the device used. Professor Philipp Stamm supervised the practical approach of my bachelor thesis as my personal mentor. You can see the type specimen on [GitHub Pages](https://miskolczy.github.io/dorn "").
