In collaboration with my fellow student Timo Reber, I was developing a proposal for a new Corporate Identity for the company Suncar <span class="uppercase">HK AG</span>. The start-up Suncar was founded from a project of the <span class="uppercase">ETH</span> in Zurich in 2015. It is focused on the electrification of construction machinery and commercial and communal vehicles. In the mutual briefing, Suncar mentioned that they wanted to be displayed as ecological, innovative and safe. These attributes helped us to derive a colour scheme and develop a word mark and pictograms. My fellow student and I then presented this collaborative approach on paper as well as online.
